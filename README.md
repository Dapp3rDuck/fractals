# Fractals
* This script will prompt for in input of a fractal algorithym of the form z = z**n + c.
* c is the independent complex variable, and z is the dependent variable, changed after each iteration.
* I would suggest using the fractal z = z**2 + c with a height of 500 pixels and 1000 iterations for your first try.
* More iterations make the image more accurate, but take longer to render. 1000 iterations is a good value if your're resolution isn't too crazy.

You can explore a render that took over 130 hours in 12500 x 25000 resolution at: http://www.livepond.net/sites/mandelbrot

The python modules: Pillow and NumPy are required for the python script.

I copy pasted most of the code, so yeah.
