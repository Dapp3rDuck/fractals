# Fractals
* This script will prompt for in input of a fractal algorithym of the form c = c**n + c0.
* c0 is the independent complex variable, and c is the dependent variable, changed after each iteration.
* I would suggest using the fractal c = c**2 + c0 with a height of 500 pixels for your first try.

NOTE:<br/>
____The python modules: Pillow and NumPy are required for the python script.

Another NOTE:<br/>
____ I copy pasted most of the code, so yeah.
