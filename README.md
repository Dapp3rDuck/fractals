# Fractals
* This script will prompt for in input of a fractal algorithym of the form Z(c) = z**n + c.
* c is the independent complex variable, and z is the dependent variable, changed after each iteration.
* I would suggest using the fractal Z(c) = z**2 + c with a height of 500 pixels for your first try.

The python modules: Pillow and NumPy are required for the python script.

I copy pasted most of the code, so yeah.
